# How to access the data?

SyntheticMass has been generated by SyntheaTM, an open-source patient population simulation made available by The MITRE Corporation available at https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads

In our experiments, we have used the 1k synthea sample of data in the CSV format (available at https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea-sample-data/downloads/synthea_sample_data_csv_apr2020.zip)

Then, we converted this dataset into the OMOP CDM using the standard ETL process (available at https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-Synthea).
